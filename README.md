# AltSchool Assignment

### Todo
1. [ ] [Read about GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/quickstart)
2. [ ] [Read about Tests](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/testing/vitest-explained/)

Complete all the eight challenges. See below for details of each challenge.

## Javascript Fluency Assignment

### Challenge - 1

> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `sumOfNumbersTo` function. Calculate and return the sum of the numbers from 1 to destination.

### Challenge - 2

> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `evenNumbersWithin` function - a function that will determine and return the count, sum, arrayOfEvenNumbers within a starting point 0 and a destination. Example `evenNumbersWithin(10)` should return the count, sum, arrayOfEvenNumbers between 0 and 10.

### Challenge - 3

> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `celsiusToFahrenheit` function. Convert the array of numbers representing temperatures in Celsius, to an array of temperatures in Fahrenheit. Decimal figures in the converted values in Fahrenheit should be removed. E.g 51.21 should just be 51 (hint: Math.trunc(...) function)
 See <https://www.thoughtco.com/celcius-to-farenheit-formula-609227> for the conversion formula.

### Challenge - 4

> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `oddNumbersWithin` function. From challenge 2, your job is to store the values of even numbers into an array. The count, sum, arrayOfOddNumbers will be in an object.

### Challenge - 5

> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `findMultiples` function. Given an array of numbers, find all numbers that are multiples of a given factor. Return an object containing the count of multiples, their sum, and an array of the multiples.

### Challenge - 6

> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `calculateFactorials` function. Given an array of numbers, calculate the factorial of each number and return a new array. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. Note: 0! = 1 and negative numbers should return 0.

### Challenge - 7

> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `findPrimeNumbers` function. Given an array of numbers, find all prime numbers and return an object containing the count of primes, their sum, and an array of the prime numbers found. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Challenge - 8

> In `src/assignment.js`, implement the `doubleTheValues` function. Given an array of numbers, return the double of the values.
